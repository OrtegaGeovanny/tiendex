Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - **Firebase Singleton Pattern**: Initialize Firebase app, auth, and db once and reuse across the app (lib/firebase/client.ts)\n9: - **Error Handling**: Centralize Firebase error messages with user-friendly translations (lib/firebase/firestore.ts)\n10: - **Firestore Timestamps**: Always use Timestamp.now() for createdAt/updatedAt fields and convert to Date when needed\n11: - **Security Rules**: Use helper functions in Firestore rules for cleaner, more maintainable permissions\n12: - **Type Organization**: Separate types (types.ts) from operations (customers.ts) for better maintainability\n13: - **Auth Context Pattern**: Use React Context with onAuthStateChanged for centralized auth state management across Next.js App Router\n14: - **Landing Page Pattern**: Use server components for static landing pages with Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Break sections into focused components for maintainability.\n15: - **Client Component Pattern**: Use \"use client\" directive for components using hooks (useState, useEffect, motion from framer-motion) or interactive features\n16: - **Framer Motion Animations**: Use whileHover and whileTap for interactive card animations with spring physics for smooth feel\n17: - **Responsive Grid Layout**: Use Tailwind grid with responsive classes (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4) for adaptive layouts\n18: - **CRUD Form Pattern**: Separate add and edit pages that share similar form structure and validation with large touch targets (py-4), text-lg inputs, and stacked layouts for mobile-first design\n19: - **Success/Error Feedback Pattern**: Use colored banners (green for success, red for errors) with icons (Check, X) and action buttons for clear user feedback\n20: - **Notification Panel Pattern**: Overlay modal with backdrop, header with close button, scrollable content list, empty state with icon, and action buttons per item\n21: - **Badge Counter Pattern**: Bell icon with badge showing count (9+ for >9 items) in top-right corner using absolute positioning\n22: - **React useCallback Pattern**: Memoize callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders and fix ESLint exhaustive-deps warnings\n23: - **Prettier Configuration**: Use .prettierrc for consistent code formatting with single quotes, no semicolons, and 2-space indentation\n24: - **Footer Pattern**: 4-column responsive grid with company info, product links, support links, and social media; dark background for visual hierarchy; gradient brand name for continuity; dynamic copyright year; border-top separator (components/Footer.tsx)\n25: - **Input Validation Pattern**: Validate database inputs before operations (check for empty strings, non-negative numbers) and throw descriptive error messages (lib/firebase/products.ts)\n26: - **CRUD Helper Pattern**: Use addDoc for create (auto-generates ID), updateDoc for updates, deleteDoc for deletion, with Timestamp.now() for createdAt/updatedAt (lib/firebase/products.ts)\n27: - **Partial Update Pattern**: Use TypeScript optional fields in input interfaces (UpdateProductInput, UpdateCustomerInput) to allow partial document updates\n28: - **Field Sanitization Pattern**: Trim string inputs (like name) with .trim() to remove leading/trailing whitespace before database operations (lib/firebase/products.ts)\n29: - **Phone Mockup Pattern**: Use nested divs with rounded borders (rounded-[2.5rem]), gradient blurs, and shadows to create realistic phone frames. Inner container with fixed dimensions (280x560px) for screen content (components/Screenshots.tsx)\n30: - **Parallax Scroll Pattern**: Use useScroll with target ref to track element visibility, useTransform to map scrollProgress to y-axis movement for smooth parallax effects tied to scroll (components/Screenshots.tsx)\n31: - **Staggered Animation Pattern**: Multiple elements with incrementing delay values (0, 0.2, 0.4) create sequential reveal animations when combined with whileInView and viewport={{ once: true }} (components/Screenshots.tsx)\n32: - **Sorting Pattern**: Use useMemo to sort and filter arrays efficiently when they depend on multiple state variables, provide a dropdown with clear labels for sort options, default to most actionable sort (app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx)\n33: - **Status Badge Pattern**: Use inline-flex, rounded-full, px-2 py-1 for small status badges with appropriate background/text colors (e.g., bg-red-100 text-red-800 for \"Due\" badge) (app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx)\n34: - **List vs Grid Pattern**: Use vertical list layout when displaying comparable numerical data (debt amounts) that users need to scan and compare quickly, use grid for browsing catalog items (app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx)\n35: - **Visual Hierarchy Pattern**: Use larger text (text-2xl) for key metrics (debt amounts) to make them stand out and improve readability on mobile devices (app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx)\n36: \n37: ---\n38: \n39: ## 2025-02-13 -

app/dashboard/customers/page.tsx - Added sorting functionality, visual badge for debt, improved mobile layout\n490: \n491: **Learnings:**\n492: \n493: - useMemo is useful for optimizing sort+filter operations that depend on multiple state variables\n494: - Vertical list layout is better than grid for displaying debt information as it's easier to scan and compare amounts\n495: - Large text-2xl font for debt amounts improves readability on mobile devices\n496: - Color coding (red for debt, green for no debt) provides immediate visual feedback\n497: - Sort order should default to most actionable option (highest debt) for customer lists\n498: - Flex-wrap on badge containers ensures badges don't cause layout issues on narrow screens\n499: \n500: **Patterns discovered:**\n501: \n502: - Sorting Pattern: Use useMemo to sort and filter arrays efficiently when they depend on multiple state variables, provide a dropdown with clear labels for sort options\n503: - Status Badge Pattern: Use inline-flex, rounded-full, px-2 py-1 for small status badges with appropriate background/text colors (e.g., bg-red-100 text-red-800 for \"Due\")\n504: - List vs Grid Pattern: Use vertical list layout when displaying comparable numerical data (debt amounts) that users need to scan and compare quickly\n505: - Visual Hierarchy Pattern: Use larger text (text-2xl) for key metrics (debt amounts) to make them stand out and improve readability\n506: \n507: ---\n508: \n509: ## [2025-02-14] -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- **Firebase Singleton Pattern**: Initialize Firebase app, auth, and db once and reuse across the app (lib/firebase/client.ts)\n- **Error Handling**: Centralize Firebase error messages with user-friendly translations (lib/firebase/firestore.ts)\n- **Firestore Timestamps**: Always use Timestamp.now() for createdAt/updatedAt fields and convert to Date when needed\n- **Security Rules**: Use helper functions in Firestore rules for cleaner, more maintainable permissions\n- **Type Organization**: Separate types (types.ts) from operations (customers.ts) for better maintainability\n- **Auth Context Pattern**: Use React Context with onAuthStateChanged for centralized auth state management across Next.js App Router\n- **Landing Page Pattern**: Use server components for static landing pages with Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Break sections into focused components for maintainability.\n- **Client Component Pattern**: Use \"use client\" directive for components using hooks (useState, useEffect, motion from framer-motion) or interactive features\n- **Framer Motion Animations**: Use whileHover and whileTap for interactive card animations with spring physics for smooth feel\n- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Use Tailwind grid with responsive classes (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4) for adaptive layouts\n- **CRUD Form Pattern**: Separate add and edit pages that share similar form structure and validation with large touch targets (py-4), text-lg inputs, and stacked layouts for mobile-first design\n- **Success/Error Feedback Pattern**: Use colored banners (green for success, red for errors) with icons (Check, X) and action buttons for clear user feedback\n- **Notification Panel Pattern**: Overlay modal with backdrop, header with close button, scrollable content list, empty state with icon, and action buttons per item","truncated":false,"loaded":[]},"time":{"start":1771105212720,"end":1771105212728}}}}
