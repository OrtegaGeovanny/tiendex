The product replaces the traditional paper notebook used to track products, inventory, customers, and credit (\"fiado\").\n6: \n7: The system consists of:\n8: 1. **Marketing landing page** - Modern, bold, slightly brutalist design to attract store owners\n9: 2. **Private dashboard** - Minimal, fast interface for managing products, customers, and credit transactions\n10: \n11: The MVP focuses on core functionality: product/customer management and streamlined credit tracking, with the primary view being a customer list showing who owes what.\n12: \n13: ## Goals\n14: \n15: -

Animations: Framer Motion\n459: - Backend: Firebase (Firestore + Authentication)\n460: - Hosting: Vercel\n461: - Internationalization: next-intl or react-i18next\n462: \n463: **Data Model:**\n464: - Firestore structure: `/stores/{userId}/` with subcollections for products, customers, transactions\n465: - One user = one store (userId serves as storeId)\n466: - Denormalize product names in transactions for historical accuracy\n467: - Use Firestore listeners for real-time updates (optional) or standard queries\n468: \n469: **Mobile-First Considerations:**\n470: -

**User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback confirms it's \"faster than paper\"\n495: \n496: ## Open Questions\n497: \n498: - Should we add a simple onboarding tutorial/tour for first-time users?\n499: - Do we need a \"quick actions\" widget on the dashboard home for frequent tasks?\n500: - Should product stock auto-decrement when credit is given, or should this be optional per-product?\n501: - What currency symbol should we use by default? (MXN $, COP $, ARS $, etc. - may need user setting)\n502: - Should we implement soft deletes for products/customers to preserve transaction history integrity?\n503: - Do we want to add a \"notes\" field to credit transactions for context (e.g., \"2 bottles of soda\")?\n504: \n\n(End of file - total 504 lines)\n</content>","title":"tasks/prd-tiendexapp.md","metadata":{"preview":"# PRD: TiendexApp - Credit & Inventory Management for Small Latin American Stores\n\n## Overview\n\nTiendexApp is a mobile-first SaaS web application designed for small local stores and family-owned businesses in Latin America.
